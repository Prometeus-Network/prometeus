<h3 align="center"> Decentralized social network and data marketplace</h3>
 <br> 
 <br>

Prometeus Network is a secure and decentralized protocol that allows fully trustless and anonymous data exchange through the use of PROM token. Thus one can say that PROM is like BitCoin for data. This opens a new set of opportunities in the data exchange as well as enriching the transactional side of public blockchain application. 

We have been developing two products: Stoa, Decentralized Data Exchange Platform, which allows to buy and sell any file worldwide without limitations and Ignite, Decentralized Microblogging Service, which allows to communicate globally without any form of censorship.

<h3 align="center"> Stoa: Decentralized Data Exchange Platform</h3>
<br> 

Stoa is a distributed platform that allows users to buy and sell any data in a secure and decentralized way. The whole process is anonymous and does not require any KYC. You need just start a node to become a buyer or seller within the System. Any user can exchange any type of data (documents, pictures, videos, etc). Data Exchange serves as a decentralized cross horizontal hub for big data (Health Care, Finance, Public, Research, Retail, Marketing) and connects data providers from any industry to the data consumers.

<h3 align="center"> Ignite: Decentralized Microblogging Service</h3>
<br> 

Ignite is a decentralized social network, which allows everyone to share her/his mind freely via texts and media files. All the posts are distributed through Ethereum blockchain and stored immutable in distributed Data Storage. This storage is able to store necessary data and media for a period of 10-100 years. It is based on Bit Torrent File System, so Ignite could not be blocked by any form of barrier or firewall.

Our mission is to create a free flow of information online. It is a way to communicate globally that supports individual liberty of everyone without any form of censorship. Due to its decentralized nature Ignite will not be governed by anyone and cannot be controlled by authorities.

## Features
Autonomous & Open data exchange controlled by users : Prometeus is open source public blockchain protocol, anyone can take any role in the Prometeus Network, data providers and data consumers control the transactions in a real market form, setting price, privacy & security levels.

Private and censorship resistant - Prometeus protocol operated on a public blockchain and used decentralised storage and ensures selective disclosure of personal and transactional data by the user. 

Quality assurance of data: although Prometeus can not do quality assurance directly, we have built in protocol a transparent and comprehensive rating system that allows new market participants to filter data providers. 

## Our Principles

Ignite is a decentralized social network, consists of multiple independent and equitable nodes, which communicate via the blockchain. Our mission is to create a free flow of information online. It is a way to communicate globally that supports individual liberty of everyone without any form of censorship. Due to its decentralized nature Ignite will not be governed by anyone and cannot be controlled by authorities.

Stoa is a decentralized File Exchange platform. Much of the trust in Stoa comes from the fact that it requires no trust at all. System itself cannot access the data due to encryption protocols. All transactions are fully transparent and governed by logic defined in the smart contract. Stoa is fully open-source and decentralized. Anyone has access to the entire source code at any time and verify exactly how it works. Thus one can say that PROM is like Bitcoin for data.

Data Owners is the person or the company that have got some valuable data and Data Validator uploads the data to the System. Service Node is intermediate layer between all other actors into the System. If some brand or agency (Data Mart's client) would like to purchase some of that valuable data, they pay to the Data Mart for it. Data Mart purchases PROM tokens at the crypto exchange: that ensures PROM tokens liquidity and demand. When Service Node performs a data delivery, Data Validator grants that Data Owners will be rewarded for their data.

The scheme below clearly shows the general procedure of the circulation of the data and PROM tokens within the System.

1. Data Owners share their Valuable Data with Data Validator.
2. Data Validator checks up their data and validate them. Data Validator encrypts the data and upload it to the Data Broker (integral part of Service Node). Service Node stores the data in the Distributed Data Storage. Now the Valuable Data is ready for further purchase.
3. With the passage of time, some end users explored the data and found it interesting. So, they decided to purchase it via Data Mart
4. Data Mart started the purchase process: she wants to buy the Valuable Data for PROM tokens via Service Node.
5. Smart contract distributes PROM tokens among parties to a transaction. 
6. Data Owners are now rewarded for their Valuable Data. 
7. Data Validator already approved the transaction (decryption key granted) so the Service Node will take care about purchased data: retrieve them from Distributed Data Storageand pass them to the Data Mart.
8. Data Mart uses the decryption key and passed the decrypted Valuable Data to the end users.

## Tech stack

Fork of [Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum): decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, applications that run exactly as programmed without possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.

Ethereum Plasma: an off-chain solution that strives to significantly increase the overall performance of the Ethereum network, by creating a tree-like structure of numerous smaller chains, which would be able to handle more transactions per second.

[Soter](https://gitlab.com/btfs_ignite): a distributed storage solution based on BitTorrent File System ([BTFS](https://www.bittorrent.com/ru/token/bittorrent-file-system/)). We use it as a base of our disrtibuted data storage module that allows us to store the data in most secured and decentralized way.

[Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch): a search engine provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine. We use it for caching metadata from the blockchain and that allows Data Mart users to explore the Data Owner's data fast and easy.

## Ignite nodes

Ignite conists of the set of homogeneous independent Nodes. Here are the repos, which contain more detailed information about Ignite Node:

- [Ignite front-end repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-front-end)
- [Ignite back-end repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-back-end)
- [Ignite blockchain repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/ignite-blockchain)

## Stoa nodes

Stoa conists of three types of the nodes:

- Data Validator, which deals with Data Owners and uploads their valuable data to the System
- Data Mart, which enables everybody to explore and buy the valuable data in the System
- Service Node, running the communication service that implements a delivery guarantee: intermediate layer between Data Validators and Data marts.

### Data Validator node 

Data Validator node is an application which is responsible for aggregation and validation of the data from the Data Owners and provide it to Prometeus ecosystem. It provides RESTful API  and user interface for uploading data. The Node uploads data of Data Owners to the Prometeus network using API of Service Node so that it can become available for purchase to Data marts. The payment for the storage of that data is charged at the moment of upload via the smart contract. Besides that, Data Validator Node makes initial encryption of uploaded data using the Data Owner's public key.

Here is a [Data Validator repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/data-validator-node) with more detailed information abouth this Node.

### Data Mart node 

Data Mart node is an application which is used for purchasing data and proceeding it to the buyer (end user: some brand or agency outside the System). It allows to browse metadata (via special UI) and purchase any Data Ownersâ€™ data within the System using API of Service Node. Besides that, Data Validator Node makes final decryption of the data.

Here is a [Data Mart repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/data-mart-node) with more detailed information abouth this Node.

### Service node 

Service Node is a distributed application which acts as an intermediate layer between all the Roles within the System. Service Node uses based on private Ethereum network + Ethereum Plasma under the hood: due to the requirement of providing large volumes of information to the clients the quickest way possible. Service Node arranges the storage of encrypted data in a distributed data storage, and metadata in Ethereum blockchain. Upon data uploading Data Validator commits payment which is distributed among Service Nodes via smart contract. Upon data purchasing Data Mart (see below) commits payment which is distributed among Data Validators and Data Owners via smart contract. Part of each purchase payment is kept by Service Node as a commissionary fee.

Here is a [Service node repo](https://github.com/Prometeus-Network/service-node_net) with more detailed information abouth this Node.
