## Description
Prometeus Network is a secure and decentralized protocol that allows fully trustless and anonymous data exchange through the use of PROM token. Thus one can say that PROM is like BitCoin for data. This opens a new set of opportunities in the data exchange as well as enriching the transactional side of public blockchain application. 

PROM data exchange protocol allows several use case application scenarios : 
- Exchange any type of data in trustless and private manner( documents, pictures, videos, etc.);
- Serve as a decentralised cross horizontal data exchange hub for big data( prospective markets are Health Care, Finance, Public, Research, Retail, Marketing);
- Perform cross-industry data exchange: Prometeus can connect data providers from any industry to data consumers from any industry;

Some features of Prometeus Network:
- Autonomous & Open data exchange controlled by users : Prometeus is open source public blockchain protocol, anyone can take any role in the Prometeus Network, data providers and data consumers control the transactions in a real market form, setting price, privacy & security levels.
- Private and censorship resistant - Prometeus protocol operated on a public blockchain and used decentralised storage and ensures selective disclosure of personal and transactional data by the user. 
- Quality assurance of data: although Prometeus can not do quality assurance directly, we have built in protocol a transparent and comprehensive rating system that allows new market participants to filter data providers.
